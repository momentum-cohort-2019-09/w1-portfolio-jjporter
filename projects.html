                        My 1st project during my 1st week on my journey 
                        as a web developer. This one was learning to use CSS
                        to add some color, create a basic layout, and just 
                        start getting used to using this language to create 
                        cool front-end layouts.
                    </p>
                <h2>Dog Adoption Page
                    <p>
                        This webpage was designed while learning to dive 
                        deeper into CSS to make better looking design and
                        layouts that are more pleasing to the eye. Also 
                        incorporated the use of Flexbox and CSS Grid.
